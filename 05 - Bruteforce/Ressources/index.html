          <h1>Password Complexity</h1>
          <p class="lead">A strong password can take years to crack. But on this website, the password complexity
            required is too low and a bruteforce attack is very effective.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead">On the login page, we can attempt a bruteforce attack to try to log in as root or admin
            users.<br>
            To achieve that, we can use a program called thc-hydra, that is a bruteforcer.<br>
            We execute the following command:<br>
            <code>hydra -l root -P pw -fV 192.168.56.101 http-get-form "/index.php:page=signin&username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:S=The flag is"</code><br>
            -l: specifies the username<br>
            -p: specifies the password dictionnary file that we are going to use<br>
            -f: stop at first success<br>
            -V: will show all tries<br><br>
            "/index.php:page=signin&username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:S=The flag is"<br>
            This parameter is of the form 'page':'options':'success/fail message'<br><br>
            Hydra will automatically replace ^USER^ and ^PASS^ with the credentials that it tests.<br><br>
            After a few seconds, we have a result, the passwords for both users is "shadow". We can now log in and get
            the flag.<br><br>
            The flag is: B3A6E43DDF8B4BBB4125E5E7D23040433827759D4DE1C04EA63907479A80A6B2
          </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
          <h2>Risks</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead">By allowing passwords that weak, bruteforces attacks will be very fast and all of the users of
            the website could be hacked in less than an hour if they all have weak passwords.</p>

          <h2>How to fix ?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead">
            In this case, there are a lot of things to do.<br>
            First would be to send a POST request instead of a GET request, because everyone will be able to see your
            cedentials on the browser navigation bar, as the url would be like: <code>http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=signin&username=login&password=password&Login=Login#</code><br>
            Then, there is no attempt limitation on the form, which means that a bruteforce will be very easy. A way to
            counter that would be to add a captcha verification after several fails, or to lock the account for a
            certain ammount of time.<br><br>
            You could also add some MFA to ensure that even if the attacker gets the password of the user, he can't log
            in.<br><br>
            For the passwords themselves, they are really weak. You should at least ask for 1 upper case, 1 lower case,
            1 digit, 1 special character and a length of 8 chars.<br><br>
            Another thing is the storage of the passwords. By using the SQL injections on the Member and Images pages, I
            was able to dump the table that contains the users credentials. In the database, the passwords are stored
            hashed in md5.<br><br>
            <code>1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL, concat(username,0x3a,password) FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default</code></p>
            <div class="table-responsive">
              <table class="table table-striped table-hover table-bordered table-dark ">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="col">username</th>
                    <th scope="col">password</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row">root</th>
                    <td>3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row">admin</th>
                    <td>3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            <p class="lead">They are easily reversable since md5 is not that secured. It would be better to encrypt them with Argon2id
            or bcrypt. It would be also a great addition to add a salt key to them.
